Yahoo revealed that its systems had been intruded into in August 2013, and that<br>the breach compromised one billion user accounts.

An indiscriminate attack compromised systems at the San Francisco Municipal<br>Transportation Agency (the Muni), locking operators out of computers and customers out of<br>kiosks. As a result, the Muni offered customers free rides for two days, until administrators restored<br>its systems without paying the demanded $73,000 ransom.<br>November 2016. Hackers targeted AdultFriendFinder, a dating website, compromising 412<br>million users and publishing their emails, passwords, member status and purchases on online<br>criminal marketplaces.<br>November 2016.
